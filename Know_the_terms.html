            <h3>Loan Amount:</h3>
            <li>The loan amount can vary depending on the course and the educational institution you are applying to.</li>
            <li>For studies in India, loan amounts are usually capped, and for studies abroad, the loan amount may be higher.</li>
            <h3>Interest Rate:</h3>
            <li>The interest rate can be fixed or floating, and it depends on the bank's policies and your creditworthiness.</li>
            <li>Interest rates for education loans are generally lower compared to other types of loans.</li>
            <h3>Loan Tenure:</h3>
            <li>The repayment period typically starts after the completion of the course.</li>
            <li>Loan tenure can range from 5 to 15 years, depending on the loan amount and the bank's terms.</li>
            <h3>Moratorium Period:</h3>
            <li>Most education loans come with a moratorium period, which is the time during the course duration and a certain period after it when you are not required to make any repayments.</li>
            <li>The moratorium period is usually the course duration plus an additional few months or a year, depending on the bank's policy.</li>
            <h3>Collateral:</h3>
            <li>For higher loan amounts, banks may require collateral or a guarantor.</li>

            <h3>Eligibility Criteria:</h3>
            <li>The bank will assess your academic background, the reputation of the educational institution, the course you are applying for, and your ability to repay the loan when considering your eligibility.</li>
            <h3>Processing Fee:</h3>
            <li>Banks may charge a processing fee, which is a one-time payment, at the time of loan application.</li>
            

        </ul>
        <p>It's important to remember that loan terms and conditions can change over time, and different banks may have specific variations in their offerings. To get the most accurate and up-to-date information about education loan terms, interest rates, and eligibility criteria, it is recommended to directly contact the banks or lending institutions of your choice. Always review the loan agreement thoroughly before proceeding with any education loan.</p>
