    <p style="margin-top:2% ;">Some banks and lending institutions might offer flexible or customized repayment options to borrowers based on their financial circumstances. These alternative repayment plans could include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Step-Up Repayment Plan:</b> This plan allows borrowers to start with lower monthly installments at the beginning of the loan tenure, gradually increasing the repayment amount over time. This is especially useful for borrowers who expect their income to increase in the future.</li>
        <br><li><b>Step-Down Repayment Plan: </b> In contrast to the step-up plan, the step-down plan begins with higher monthly installments, which gradually decrease over time. This plan may be suitable for borrowers who anticipate a decline in their income or have other financial commitments early in their career.</li>
        <br><li><b>Interest-Only Repayment Plan: </b>Some lenders may offer a temporary interest-only repayment plan, where borrowers make smaller monthly payments that cover only the interest charges for a specific period. This allows borrowers to manage their immediate financial obligations without affecting the loan principal.</li>
        <br><li><b>Flexible EMIs:</b>Some lenders may offer the option to adjust the EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) amount based on the borrower's financial situation. Borrowers might be allowed to increase or decrease their EMI amounts within certain limits.</li>
        <br><li><b>Graduated Repayment Plan:</b>This plan starts with lower monthly installments, which increase over time at predetermined intervals. This approach might be suitable for borrowers who expect their income to grow steadily in the future.</li>
        <br><li><b>Extension of Loan Tenure:</b> In some cases, borrowers facing financial difficulties may request an extension of the loan tenure. Extending the tenure would result in smaller monthly installments, but it may also lead to higher overall interest payments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 3%;">It's important to remember that these alternative repayment plans may not be universally available, and their terms can differ among banks and lending institutions. Borrowers should check with their specific lender to see if such options are offered and what the eligibility criteria and conditions are for each plan</p>
